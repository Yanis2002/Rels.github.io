# Rail Defect Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a web-based visualization tool for railway rail defect analysis. It simulates and visualizes rail profiles, calculates defect integrals, and provides condition assessments based on the defect severity.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of rail profiles
- Calculation of defect integrals using trapezoid method
- Color-coded condition assessments
- Separate analysis of top and bottom rail profiles
- Parallel visualization of two rails
- Customizable simulation parameters

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Plotly.js for interactive visualizations

## How to Use
1. Visit the GitHub Pages site for this repository
2. Adjust the simulation parameters if desired:
   - Rail Length: The length of rails in centimeters
   - Defect Amplitude: The maximum height of defects
   - Defect Frequency: How often defects occur
3. Click "Generate New Simulation" to create a new set of rail profiles
4. Explore the different charts and analysis data
